	<h3>Welcome To Yihone Chu's Star Viewing Guide</h3>

	<p>
		In 2017 I went on a twelve day back-packing trip to Philmont Scout
		Ranch with some of my best friends.<br /> I remember stars filling up
		the entire sky and being completely overwhelmed.<br /> Here in Ohio
		the stars are not as good as they are in New Mexico.<br /> I have had
		to deploy methods and equipment to view stars more clearly.<br />
		This guide is here to help you view stars.
	</p>

	<p>Things that you will need:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>High Power Telescope</li>
		<li>Telescope Tripod</li>
		<li>Blanket to shade out light</li>
	</ol>

	<p>

	<p>Now that you have your equipment I will go over some good places
		to star gaze for each region of the US:</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>North</th>
			<th>South</th>
			<th>Midwest</th>
			<th>West</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Breezy Hill Vermont</td>
			<td>Big Pine Key</td>
			<td>Cherry Springs State Park</td>
			<td>Denali National Park</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
